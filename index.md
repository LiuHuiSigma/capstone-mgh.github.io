{% comment %} 
Overview​: Provide an overview of the project. It is important that you include a
general context for and an overall description of as well as any introductory information
that’s specific to the project.
● Motivation​: Introduce the project motivation both as a whole as well as motivations
for important defining aspects of your work. Were there any visualization or UI
primitives that informed your work.
● Description of Data​: What data are you dealing with? What methods have you used
to explore the data (incl. initial explorations, models, data cleansing and reconciliation,
etc)? What insights did you gain? How did those methods influence your work?
● Literature Review/Related Work​: This can include noting any key papers, texts,
other software sources, talks or websites that you have used to develop your modeling
approach and/or that informed your demo/site
● Modeling Approach: ​ What was your baseline model for comparison? What further
models did you implement?
● Results:​ Describe the results and emphasize the most important results. Did you have
to reconsider some of the original assumptions?
● Conclusions and Summary
● Future work
● Style​: Your work should embrace simplicity over complexity, be intuitive for an only
slightly informed user to navigate, and as much as possible be appropriately polished,
robust, and reliable. Visualizations should constructed to slice through complexity and
convey as information and insight elegantly and concisely. We recognize that these are
not going to be fully constructed products but style matters​.
● Software Deployment​: In some situations the demo or website will sit on top of a
multi-layered software stack including software service, API, and client layers. Your
team should deploy your software stack with the goal of making the final report as
self-contained as possible for the duration of the evaluation period. For teams with
sensitive data please

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/capstone-mgh/capstone-mgh.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/capstone-mgh/capstone-mgh.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

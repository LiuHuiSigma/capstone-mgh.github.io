# Machine Learning

Our ML contribution consists of two parts:

- An ML pipeline implemented in Keras and Theano that allows for live ML predictions of nodule segmentations.
- A convolutional neural network model (informally called ShapeNet) that generates malignancy scores based on the user-inputed segmentation shape.

# Goal

With a firm understanding of the current state of medical diagnosis, we form Sak√© - a precise, fast, and standardized web-based medical imaging annotation framework.  Our ambitious mission is to revolutionize medical diagnosis through machine learning by generating high-quality medical data.

To make this dream a reality, we work with MGH to determine the below specifications of this framework:

- Ability to store, retrieve, and view a range of medical images and corresponding metadata
- Accessible for radiologists across the globe
- Standardized, easy-to-use annotation framework
- Machine learning (ML) pipeline that can be easily upgraded 
- ML assists doctors in detecting regions of interests (ROIs).

With these specifications, we develop the below schematic as a guide for how to progress:

Crucial in our design is that each of the three major components communicate through well-defined interfaces and can be independently exchanged.  This will allow for the framework to be constantly improved.
